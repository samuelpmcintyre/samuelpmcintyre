Hello, I'm samuelpmcintyre!
I am a student of economics and applied math, especially interested in econometric theory and causal inference, as well as using machine learning to solve interesting problems.
Most of the files in this repository concern classwork for various applied math classes or research I have done in economics. I can program in Python, Stata, and Matlab.
I also enjoy hiking, painting, and playing the piano.
